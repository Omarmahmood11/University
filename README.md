## **University**

Welcome to my University repository on GitHub! This repository contains my lab work and academic projects during my university journey, with a primary focus on AI and Machine Learning. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my exploration, experimentation, and growth in the fascinating field of AI.

Welcome to my University repository on GitHub! This repository consists of two main folders: **Lab Work** and **Academic Projects** with a primary focus on AI and Machine Learning. Each folder represents a collection of projects that showcase my exploration, experimentation, and growth in various subjects.


### **Introduction**
Throughout my academic tenure, I have been deeply intrigued by the potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work, highlighting the various projects and assignments I completed as part of my coursework and personal interest. From fundamental algorithms to cutting-edge techniques, this collection covers a wide range of AI and ML topics.

## Lab Work

The **Lab Work** folder contains all the programs and assignments I worked on during my lab hours at the university. These exercises helped me gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience with different programming languages, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. Inside this folder, you'll find code snippets, scripts, and small projects related to the topics covered in my lab sessions.

## Academic Projects

The **Academic Projects** folder houses larger projects that I either worked on individually or contributed to as part of my coursework. These projects were completed at the end of each semester and allowed me to apply the concepts and skills I learned throughout the courses. The projects cover a wide range of subjects, with a particular focus on AI and Machine Learning.
